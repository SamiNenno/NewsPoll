###<span style="color:#DB9418">Make your code execution as easy as possible</span>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Cluster your functions in classes.**</span> <br>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Add a fit function that executes the functions of the classes in the right order.**</span>


###<span style="color:#DB9418">Structure your code in functions</span>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Whenever you can put something in a function, put it in a function.**</span> <br>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**One function is responsible one task and not many.**</span>


###<span style="color:#DB9418">Different topic, different script</span>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Put each separable part of your pipeline in a separate script.**</span> <br>


###<span style="color:#DB9418">First test, then integrate</span>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Create a playground file for testing new functions, so that you don't have to run the entire code each time.**</span> <br>


###<span style="color:#DB9418">Important data should not be saved as a local variable</span>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Save relevant data as (csv) file instead of passing it from method to method, 
so that you donâ€™t have to run your program each time and you don't lose your results.**</span> <br>

###<span style="color:#DB9418">Use well-known libraries for well-known tasks</span>
<span style="color:#6E25DB">**Many tasks are common to machine learning projects, so use the libraries that are suited to this purpose like numpy, pandas, or pytorch (they are also faster than normal python code).**</span> <br>
