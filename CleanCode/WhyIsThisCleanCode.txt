In my code, I have tried to accommodate, among others, the following points:
- No useless Code/Comments
- No free floating variables, everything is packed into classes/functions
- No repetition, if the same code is needed at different places, it was put in a function and called multiple times
- Functions are not too long and fulfill only one task
- Precise naming of variables
- classes are build with uniform pattern
- Information hiding by putting complex processes into functions with simple input and output
- No magic numbers

So far, I did not use docstrings to describe my classes and functions but I made use of
pylint, which is a python library for checking you style and it pointed me to this. So I added
docstrings for functions and classes.
