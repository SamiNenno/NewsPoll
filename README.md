# NewsPolls


Compares news coverage of German politicians/parties to election polls.




1. Use and understand Git!
2. UML at least 3 good diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all tools to view them!
    --> see folder UML
3. DDD If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 10 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with 5-0 Domains. It would be nice if these domains are derived from an Event-Storming (but not mandatory).
4. Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non trivial metrics are also fine.
5. Clean Code Development: at least 5 points you can show me + >>10 points on your personal cheat sheet
6. Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc.
7. Integrate some nice Unit-Tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build
8. Continuous Delivery: show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc.
9. Use a good IDE and get fluent with it as e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favorite Key-Shortcuts?!
    --> Pycharm: Probably, ^+alt+r for run, cmd+k for commit, shift+cmd+K for push
        Furthermore, it is helpful to add big data files to the gitignore file (no shortcut, though)
10. DSL Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project
11. Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as
    - only final data structures
    - (mostly) side effect free functions
    - the use of higher-order functions
    - functions as parameters and return values
    - use closures / anonymous functions
