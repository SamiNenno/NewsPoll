# NewsPolls


Compares news coverage of German politicians/parties to election polls.




**1.** Use and understand Git!

**2.** UML at least 3 good diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all tools to view them!*

    *--> see folder UML*

**3.** DDD If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 10 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with 5-0 Domains. It would be nice if these domains are derived from an Event-Storming (but not mandatory).

**4.** Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non trivial metrics are also fine.

**5.** Clean Code Development: at least 5 points you can show me + >>10 points on your personal cheat sheet

**6.** Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc.

**7.** Integrate some nice Unit-Tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build

**8.** Continuous Delivery: show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc.

**9.** Use a good IDE and get fluent with it as e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favorite Key-Shortcuts?!

    *--> Pycharm: Probably, ^+alt+r for run, cmd+k for commit, shift+cmd+K for push
        Furthermore, it is helpful to add big data files to the gitignore file (no shortcut, though)*

**10.** DSL Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project

**11.** Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as

    - only final data structures
    - (mostly) side effect free functions
    - the use of higher-order functions
    - functions as parameters and return values
    - use closures / anonymous functions
