# NewsPolls


Compares news coverage of German politicians/parties to election polls.




**1.** Use and understand Git!\

**2.** UML at least 3 good diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all tools to view them!\
    *-->* [see folder UML](UML) I have chosen Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Use-case Diagrams

**3.** DDD If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 10 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with 5-0 Domains. It would be nice if these domains are derived from an Event-Storming (but not mandatory).\

**4.** Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non trivial metrics are also fine.\
    *-->* [see folder Metrics](Metrics) I have chosen radon as a tool for metrics. Radon is a python library
    for cyclomatic complexity, Halstead metrics, and others. More information and documentation of the tests
    can be found [here](Metrics_Summary.md)

**5.** Clean Code Development: at least 5 points you can show me + >>10 points on your personal cheat sheet\
    *-->* [see folder CleanCode](CleanCode) Explanation can be found in the same folder or [here](WhyIsThisCleanCode.txt)

**6.** Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc.\

**7.** Integrate some nice Unit-Tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build\
    *-->* [see folder Unittest_Scripts](Unittest_Scripts). I have written some unit-tests for the Preprocess.py
    script. Since Preprocess.py is mostly concerned with scraping and loading the poll and newspaper data
    the unit tests make sure that the loaded/scraped data has the right format.

**8.** Continuous Delivery: show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc.\
    *-->* [see folder CICD](CICD). I have chosen Circle-CI as a tool. Circle-CI automatically calls flake8 (python library for style checking)
    pytest, and my self-modelled unit tests.

**9.** Use a good IDE and get fluent with it as e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favorite Key-Shortcuts?!\
    *-->* Pycharm: Probably, ^+alt+r for run, cmd+k for commit, shift+cmd+K for push
        Furthermore, it is helpful to add big data files to the gitignore file (no shortcut, though)*

**10.** DSL Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project\
    *-->* I have chosen Regular Expressions as DSL. [See folder DSL](DSL). I have implemented a function
    that allows to search through the news corpus. The searchphrase is modelled as a natural sentence with a
    common syntax like subject-verb-object or subject-adjective. You can see some example results as csv files.

**11.** Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as\
    *-->* only final data structures\
    *-->* (mostly) side effect free functions. See [Newscounter.py](Newscounter.py) "relative_count()"\
    *-->* the use of higher-order functions. See [Newscounter.py](Newscounter.py) "relative_count()"\
    *-->* functions as parameters and return values. See [Newscounter.py](Newscounter.py) "relative_count()"\
    *-->* use closures / anonymous functions. See Lambda Function in [Newscounter.py](Newscounter.py) "datecasting()"\
